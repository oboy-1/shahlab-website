abstract={Striking a balance between advancing innovation in generative AI, in particular large language models, and maintaining ethical principles is crucial for medical applications. We herein propose a new framework of collaboration, grounded in four bioethical principles, to promote responsible use of LLMs.    Original papers, reviews, narratives, correspondences, perspectives, and viewpoints that shed light on LLM use in medicine were identified through searches of PubMed and arXiv from January, 2020 to August, 2023. We excluded publications that did not discuss ethical issues. A total of 58 nonduplicate articles out of initial 1666 initial search results were retrieved for meticulous evaluation.    Major ethical conundrums of LLM in medicine includes cognitive bias, data privacy, transparency, hallucinations, accountability and responsibility. To harness the full potential of LLMs, clear ethical guidelines serve as the robust foundation, ensuring the use of LLMs remains both beneficial and just. A trinary model depicts the roles of 3 different stakeholders: patient, clinician and LLM developer, reframing the traditional patient-clinician relationship. We suggest the users follow the bioethical principles: beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy and justice, that guides the responsible use of LLMs in medicine. Patients can actively participated in decision-making and be fully aware of the technological tools shaping their healthcare journey.    This balanced approach facilitates symbiotic integration of LLMs into healthcare; leveraging technological capabilities while upholding bioethical standards.  This abstract was presented at the 2024 ARVO Annual Meeting, held in Seattle, WA, May 5-9, 2024.},

    abstract = { Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise related to their application in medical research, medical education, and clinical tasks. While acknowledging their capabilities, we face the challenge of striking a balance between defining and holding ethical boundaries and driving innovation in LLM technology for medicine. We herein propose a framework, grounded in four bioethical principles, to promote the responsible use of LLMs. This model requires the responsible application of LLMs by three parties — the patient, the clinician, and the systems that govern the LLM itself — and suggests potential approaches to mitigating the risks of LLMs in medicine. This approach allows us to use LLMs ethically, equitably, and effectively in medicine. Large language models (LLMs) are adopted in diverse applications, generating exciting innovations in health care. Widespread investigation LLMs has introduced important ethical discussions, including potential for bias perpetuation and medical misinformation dissemination. A framework guided by bioethical principles could guide responsible use of LLMs, but it requires a collaborative effort between patients, clinicians, and systems that govern LLM development and implementation. }

GenAI in the short term when applied top-down has unclear value, but encouraging more bottom-up adoption has the potential to provide more benefit to health systems and patients.GenAI in healthcare can provide the most value for patients when health systems adapt culturally to grow with this new technology and its adoption patterns.}",
