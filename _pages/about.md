We analyze multiple types of health data (EHR, Claims, Wearables, Weblogs, and Patient blogs), in service of the learning health system [(see examples)](https://shahlab.stanford.edu/doku.php?id=more_details).

We answer clinical questions using aggregate patient data at the [bedside](http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2016winter/on-the-button.html). The [Informatics Consult Service](https://shahlab.stanford.edu/doku.php?id=greenbutton) put this [idea](https://shahlab.stanford.edu/greenbutton_idea) in action and led to the creation of [Atropos Health](https://www.atroposhealth.com/).

We make predictions that allow taking mitigating actions, [keeping the human in the loop](https://stanmed.stanford.edu/artificial-intelligence-puts-humanity-health-care/). The [Program for AI in Healthcare](https://shahlab.stanford.edu/doku.php?id=rail&redirect=1) conducts the research which the [Applied Data Science](https://shahlab.stanford.edu/doku.php?id=dsatshc&redirect=2) team puts into practice.

We develop methods to analyze multiple datatypes for generating insights. Such as:

* Identifying [biomarkers for poor outcomes in fibrotic diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213260018305083), learning [reference intervals of laboratory tests](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26707631) and [monitoring Point-of-Care glucose meters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26988586) using routine laboratory testing data.

* Detecting skin adverse reactions by analyzing content in a [health social network](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2673831), enabling [medical device surveillance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31583282/), discovering drug adverse events as well as drug-drug interactions [from clinical notes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23571773) using novel methods for [processing textual documents](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/agile-nlp-clinical-text-covid-19-and-beyond).

* Inferring physical function from [wearables data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30394876), predicting healthcare utilization from [Web search logs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27655225) and understanding [information seeking behavior](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26293444) of health professionals.
